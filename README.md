# Characterization of linear optical interferometers
Implementing the Laing-O'Brien super-stable tomography protocol in python.
Super-stable tomography protocol by Laing-0'Brien: Anthony Laing and Jeremy L. O’Brien. Super-stable tomography of any linear optical device. arXiv:1208.2868 [quant-ph]. Aug. 2012.
Code provided contains:
1) Simulation tool to simulate the necesarry inputs (measurement results) for the protocol.
2) Simulation tool for partially distinguishable photons as probing photons for the interferometer characterization in order to examine the effects of measurement data created from partially distinguishable photons on the performance of the matrix reconstruction protocol.
3) Measure of fidelity between the original and reconstructed matrices is defined.
4) Haar-random matrix generator.
5) Computational cost analysis (local).
6) Implementation of LO'B protocol.
